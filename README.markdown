# adt-html.js

Treat HTML like any old [algebraic data type (ADT)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type)! Use it with [adt.js](https://github.com/rehno-lindeque/adt.js).

## XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention

**WARNING: ADT-HTML.JS HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED YET - PLEASE WAIT FOR AN OFFICIAL RELEASE BEFORE TRUSTING IT FOR XSS PREVENTION!**

**TODO (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED):** Besides all the other benefits of working directly with ADT's this library also helps to prevent common encoding problems that can (in addition to being an annoyance) be used for XSS (Cross Site Scripting) attacks.
